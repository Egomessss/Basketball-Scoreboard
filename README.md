What I added to improve functionality:
What started as a simple scoreboard with just the functionality to display 1's, 2's and 3's to show my skills to add interactivity to a web application quicly turned into something more as i added the following features once I acquired new knowledge:

- A display that says who won, once the button to end the game is clicked;
- A button to end the game;
- A button to start a new game, which reset the values to 0.
